"""Guarded, throttled, monotonic progress mirroring (G5.1 B2).

Bounded 0–99 while processing (100 arrives only with the success
transaction), never moving backwards, and only while this claim's token still
owns the PROCESSING row. The executor polls status.json every 200 ms; an
unthrottled mirror would commit the same (stage, progress) five times a
second for the whole run. Dedup + a modest write interval keep database
traffic bounded while stage changes and near-final progress still land
immediately.
